>Development of background radiation monitoring with IoT based device

## Objectives

- Flash ESP32 with Micropython
- Setup 400v voltage output to count radioactivity from SBM-20 with 4.5M MÎ© series resistor
- Measures radioactive gamma and beta and alpha radiation with quite good resolution
- Use of shields to detect particles
- Use of ULTRASONIC SENSOR to detect location of the sample
- Collcet the data from the serial and then add them to a list of array by using python script
- Use of MQTTClient to pass the observed data to network
- Use of Node-RED to programe for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways.
